# Number Guessing Game
A simple application that generates a random number for the user to guess. If the user guesses correctly, the user wins. If not, the user will keep guessing until the correct number is guessed. (Only a simple game that accepts integers. Exception handling is not implemented for non-integers at the moment...)
